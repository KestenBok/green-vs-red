# Green vs. Red

This project represents a little 2D Array based game.
A Two Dimensional grid is formed, based on the user's input,
which is then filled with red (0s) and green (1s) cells.
One cell gets chosen and the point of the program is to calculate how many rounds the cell stays green for.

# Installation

#### Install TypeScript with `npm install`, if you do not have a global installation.

#### Run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript code.

#### Run `npm start` to run the game.
